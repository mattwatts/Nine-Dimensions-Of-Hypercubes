Nine dimensions of Hypercubes

The first nine dimensions of hypercubes folding in 3D space on an endless repeating loop. We omit dimension zero, 0D, "Point". 

IKB Blue palette. A 45 second infinite loop animation made with maths modelling and simulation. Brain Computer Interface Optimisation BCI with high dimensional modelling, simulation, and visualisation.

Made for Kids. Maths is everywhere.

Animations generated with Python scripts. Python code included. Maths models and simulations produce the images. Python Code generated by a Deep Research Protocol.

Includes "The Logic Garden". Python-based generative curriculum aimed at Early Stage Cognitive Development.

Includes Yves Klein inspired series. An homage to his nearly 200 blue monochrome paintings in International Klein Blue pigment. Klein's colour scheme is used in some other works.
